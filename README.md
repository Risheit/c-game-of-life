# Conway's Game of Life

A basic Game of Life implementation using C and SDL.

Built using

```bash
cmake -B build/
cmake --build ./build
```

On MacOS, the app can be launched using the convenience `./launch-game.sh` script.
Otherwise, the game can be launched directly from the executable in the `build/` folder.
